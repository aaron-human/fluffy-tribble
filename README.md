# Fluffy Tribble #

This is what happens when I get so confused by nPhysics that I decide to try and roll my own. This will probably be a disaster. :)

I will try and keep it simple.

Also, the only reason why I'm creating this is so it can be integrated into a Web Assembly project. So that's the main target.

## Why the Name "Fluffy-Tribble"? ##

GitHub recommended it. I figured it was silly, much like this project, so why not?

Didn't realize it was an actual thing from _Star Trek_ until after the first commit. Probably would've made the name even more nonsense if I had known that.
