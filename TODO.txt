Isolate entities so that one can't bug out and cause all of them to lose all collision. This is probably the time step value occasionally becomeing non-finite.

Also isolate entities so that one entity can't freeze up the entire simulation if it takes a lot of computation. Maybe have it "give up" on that entity or collision pair if it takes too many? (And then move on to all the other entities/pairings.)

Add a rectangle collider.

Add some sort of "rolling friction" drag?

More efficient collision detection.
